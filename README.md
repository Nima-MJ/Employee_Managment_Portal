# Employee Managment Portal

## Purpose
Project Description: Employee Tracker

The Employee Tracker is a web-based application designed to manage and organize employee information. The app enables the creation of employee profiles, including essential details such as name, employee number, department, date of joining, and a profile picture. These profiles are stored in a SQL Server database, allowing for real-time updates and access to information.

Was built from scratch using technologies such as SQL Server for database management, .Net Core Web API for robust back-end development, and Angular 10 for seamless front-end experience. Began by setting up the development environment, creating necessary databases and objects, and implementing API endpoints with .Net Core Web API. Utilize Angular 10 to design the front-end, including a navigation menu built with Bootstrap, intuitive routing, modal pop-up windows with dropdowns and date pickers, and the ability to upload a profile picture that is stored within the app. Enhance the user experience with custom filtering and sorting features, delivering a seamless and efficient solution. The Employee Tracker streamlines the process of managing and organizing employee information, making it a valuable tool for any business looking to improve their HR processes.

## Built with 
* Back-End: ASP.Net Framework (language used C#)
* Front-End: Angular 10 (HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Bootstrap)
